Is there a sample bias given this vector all:

    all <- c(cam,cse,se,tr,exc)

where `all` comprises:

	cam <- c(27,28,39,41,41,41)
	cse <- c(27,29,29,30,31,32,33,34,38,39,41,51)
	se  <- c(23,27,28,30,31,34,38,39,rep(41,2),43,45)
	tr  <- c(49,38,47,58)
	exc <- c(38,39,rep(40,3),46,47,49,51,53)

what are the odds that a random selection of 7 elements will have 4 with value 40 or higher?
